To who else but Chris? Shimmering Focus gave me a platform to work with after my frustration with the breaking changes with Sanctum. And he's really supportive. If you're reading this, Chris, take this 💙.

Cecilia also reached out, and we had (still have!) superb conversations over user experience and on design philosophies, and for that I'm also eternally grateful!
